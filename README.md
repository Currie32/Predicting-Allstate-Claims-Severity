# Predicting-Allstate-Claims-Severity
My submission for Kaggle's "Allstate Claims Severity" competition.

Please feel free to have a look at any of the files to view my code. I recommend choosing either the .ipynb or .html as they should have the highest levels of readability. If you would like to interact with my code, you'll need to download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity. You can also learn more about the competition using that link.
